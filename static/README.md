# Static assets directory for Brand Deconstruction Station

This directory contains static assets for the cyberpunk terminal interface.

## Structure

- `css/` - Custom stylesheets (if needed beyond inline styles)
- `js/` - Additional JavaScript modules
- `images/` - Static images and assets
- `fonts/` - Custom fonts (currently using Google Fonts CDN)

## Current Implementation

The application currently uses inline CSS and JavaScript for simplicity and standalone operation. All cyberpunk styling and matrix effects are embedded in the HTML template.

## Future Assets

Potential additions:
- Cyberpunk sound effects
- Additional terminal animations
- Brand logos for analysis
- Generated satirical images
